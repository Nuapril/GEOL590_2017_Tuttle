-This week is about how to combine actual scholarship (code or data analysis) with the advertisement of your scholarship (papers and manuscripts)

-Markup languages:
	-Rules for marking up plain text with cues that give and idea or dictate how the text will be formatted
	
	-HTML
		-Most common
		
		<HTML>
			<H1>Introduction</H1>
			My paper is really interesting
		</HTML>
		
	-Markdown
		-Functional markup language that is able to be interpreted in plain text
		-Somewhat limited in scope
		
		#Introduction
		My research is really interesting
		
		##Subsection
		No, it's **really** interesting
		*bullet1
		*bullet2
		
	-LaTeX/tex
		-Not really a markup language? But acts like one
		-Give phenomenal control over document formatting
		-Can be interpreted in plain text which is great as it can be read by the computer
		
		
-Sample workflow:	
	.Rmd/.Rnw

-GitHub will interpret markdown for you. Will not run R code for you.
	-If the file has been knitted (combined code and text), can easily be seen by others on GitHub.

-Be careful when working with these files to make sure that you are pulling/putting files in the correct directories
	-Use ".." notation to move up a directory
	
-Using R notebook, you can essentially write the paper at the same time that you are actually running the analysis.
