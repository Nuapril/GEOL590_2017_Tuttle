Data visualization with ggplot

-R has multiple, dinstinct plotting systems
	-base graphics
	-lattice graphics
	-ggplot2
	
-The base R system
	-Is extremely flexible
	-Can easily make plots that are incorrect or nonsensicle
	
-ggplot2
	-ggplot2 wants you to decribe a plot, not build it
	-name stands for a grammar of graphics
	-Helps you to think about what a plot should look like
	
	-When creating a plot you need:
		-dataset
		-what kind of plot
		-axes/data mapping
			-map variable to x-axis say
		-scale
		
		Required:
		-dataset
		-an aesthetic mapping (how are data mapped to visual elements?)
			-aes()
		-Type of plot: a geom
			geom_xxx()
			-geomes generally associated with stats
				-ggplot will guess what type of stat you want to use
		-A statistical transformation (includes identity transformation)
			stat_xxx()
		-Scales
		-A coordinate system
		-A faceting system
		-Decoration
		
	-Cant do: (if hard, you probably shouldnt be doing it anyway)
		-multiple axis plots
		-3D plots
		-strangely transformed axes
		-bar graphs, easily
		-many discipline-specific plots
